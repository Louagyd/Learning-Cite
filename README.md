# Learning-Spot
Some implementations of popular learning models from scratch...
## Projects:
* [Word2Vec](Word2Vec): making a **word embedding** and then test it using **skip-gram** model with python and tensorflow.
* [SenGen](SenGen): predicting next word and **generating sentences** using dynamic lstm rnn and **gensim embedding** with python and tensorflow. 
* [OCR](OCR): **converting image to text** using convolutional and recurrent layers by optimizing a **ctc loss** with python and tensorflow.
* [GAN](GAN): the popular generative adversarial networks for **generating images** based on a training data with python and tensorflow.
